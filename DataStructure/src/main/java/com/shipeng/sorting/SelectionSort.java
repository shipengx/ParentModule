/*
 * Given an array of integers, sort the elements in the array in ascending order.
 * The selection sort algorithm should be used to solve this problem.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * {1} is sorted to {1}
 * {1,2,3} is sorted to {1,2,3}
 * {3,2,1} is sorted to {1,2,3}
 * {4,2,-3,6,1} is sorted to {-3, 1, 2, 4, 6}
 * 
 * Corner cases:
 *     what if the given array is null? in this case, we do not need to do anything.
 *     what if the given array is of length zero ? in this case, we do not need to do anything.
