/*
 * Find leaves of Binary tree
 * 
 * Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:
 * Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Given binary tree:
 *      1
 *    2   3
 *  4  5
 *  
 * return [4,53], [2], [1].
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 1. remove the leaves [4,5,3] would result in this tree:
 *      1
 *    2
 * 2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:
 *      1
 * 3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:
 *      []
 * Returns [4,5,3], [2], [1].
