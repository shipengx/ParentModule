/*
 * In-order traversal of Binary Tree
 * Implement an iterative, in-order traversal of a given binary tree,
 * return the list of keys of each node in the tree as it is in-order traversed.
 * Examples:
 *                    5
 *               3        8
 *            1    4        11
 *           in-order traversal is [1,3,4,5,8,11]
 *           Corner cases
 *               What if the given binary tree is null ? return an empty list in this case.
 *
