/*
 * Path Sum III
 * 
 * You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.
 * Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.
 * The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (travelling only 
 * from parent nodes to child nodes).
 * the tree has no more than 1000 nodes and the values are in the range -1000000 to 1000000.
 * 
 * Example:
 * root = [10, 5, -3, 3, 2, null, 11, 3, -2, null, 1], sum = 8
 * 
 *             10
 *          5     -3
 *        3   2      11
 *      3  -2   1
 *      
 * Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:
 * 1. 5 ---> 3
 * 2. 5 ---> 2 ---> 1
 * 3. -3 ---> 11
