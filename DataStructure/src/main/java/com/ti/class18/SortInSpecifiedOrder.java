/*
 * Sort in specified order
 * 
 * Given two integer arrays A1 and A2, sort A1 in such a way that the relative order among the elements
 * will be the same as those are in A2.
 * 
 * For the elements that are not in A2, append them in the right end of the A1 in an ascending order.
 * 
 * Assumptions:
 *     A1 and A2 are both not null.
 *     There are no duplicate elements in A2.
 *     
 * Examples:
 *     A1 = {2, 1, 2, 5, 7, 1, 9, 3},
 *     A2 = {2, 1, 3}, 
 *     A1 is sorted to {2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
