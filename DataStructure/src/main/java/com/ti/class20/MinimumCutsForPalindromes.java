 * Minimum cuts for palindromes
 * 
 * Given a string, a partitioning of the string is a palindrome partitioning if every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
 * Determine the fewest cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of a given string.
 * 
 * Assumptions
 *     The given string is not null
 *  
 * Examples
 * "a | babbbab | bab | aba" is a palindrome partitioning of "ababbbabbababa".
 * 
 * The minimum number of cuts needed is 3.
