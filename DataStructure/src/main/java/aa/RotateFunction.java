 * Rotate Function
 * 
 * Given an array of integers A and let n to be its length.
 * 
 * Assume Bk to be an array obtained by rotating the array A k positions clock-wise, 
 * we define a "rotation function" F on A as follow:
 * 
 * F(k) = 0 * Bk[0] + 1 * Bk[1] + ... + (n-1) * Bk[n-1].
 * 
 * Calculate the maximum value of F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1).
 * 
 * Note:
 * n is guaranteed to be less than 10^5.
