/*
 * Longest palindromic subsequence
 * Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.
 * You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * input:
 * "bbbab"
 * 
 * Output:
 * 4
 * One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * input:
 * "cbbd"
 * output:
 * 2
 * 
 * One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
